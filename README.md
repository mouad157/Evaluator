## AI Model Evaluation for Question Answering

### üìå Overview
This project evaluates the performance of different AI models (OpenAI GPT, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Anthropic) 
on question-answering tasks. It:
- Predicts question types using a fine-tuned LLaMA model.
- Generates model answers for given questions.
- Compares generated answers with ground truth answers.
- Computes similarity scores to measure model accuracy.
- Saves results in a CSV file and optionally stores them in a MongoDB database.

### üöÄ Features
- Supports multiple AI models (OpenAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Anthropic).
- Fine-tuned LLaMA model for question classification.
- Automatic evaluation with scoring metrics.
- MongoDB storage for result tracking.

### üîß Setup & Installation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Running Model Evaluation
To evaluate a model using a dataset, call the evaluate function:
```
from src.main import evaluate

input_file = "data/questions.csv"  # Path to your CSV file
model_name = "gpt-4o"  # Change to your model
api_key = "your-api-key"  # Replace with your key
system_prompt = "Answer concisely."
metric = "f1_score"  # Adjust as needed

df, avg_score = evaluate(input_file, model_name, api_key, system_prompt, metric)

print(f"Model accuracy: {avg_score:.2f}%")
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Saving Results to MongoDB
```
from src.main import save_mongodb

mongo_client = "mongodb://localhost:27017"
database_name = "AI_Evaluation"
collection_name = "Results"

save_mongodb(df, mongo_client, database_name, collection_name)
print("Results saved to MongoDB!")
```
